# Module 5: PyBer with MatPlotLib

## Overview of the Analysis

In this challenge, a python-based ridesharing company, PyBer, is requesting an analysis of data for 2,375 trips and 120 cities using Python Pandas and MatPlotLib.

## Results

This project aims to identify and visualize the effect of city type (rural, suburban, or urban) on ridership.

### Summary DataFrame

The data was first summarized to show Rider, Driver, and Fare specifics for Rural, Suburban, and Urban city types. See Table 1: PyBer_Summary_DataFrame
![Table 1](/M5_Challenge/Analysis/Table1_PyBer_Summary_DataFrame.png "Table 1: Summary DataFrame")

Urban city types had the greatest number of rides and drivers (1,625 and 2,405, respectively). Urban cities had the lowest fares, averaging $24.53 per ride and $16.57 per driver. Given the volume of trips taken, urban cities had the highest revenue among city types, with fares totaling $39,854.38. 

Rural areas had the lowest ridership and driver counts (totaling 125 and 78, respectively). In contrast, Rural areas had the highest fares, averaging $34.62 per ride and $55.49 per driver. This low volume of trips resulted in the lowest revenue among city types, with fares totaling $4,327.93. 

Suburban areas fell between urban and rural city types in all parameters noted above.
