# Module 4: PyCitySchools with Pandas

## Overview of the Project

In this challenge, academic data for 14,831 high-school students was prepared, summarized, and analyzed using Python Pandas.

## Data Preparation

The data was prepared by dropping any blank values, along with duplicates that could skew the data. The data was also cleaned to ensure that integer values would not be converted to string format.

## Data Summary

The data was then summarized using summary statistics. Reading scores ranged from 10.5 to 100.0, averaging 72.4 with a standard deviation of 15.2, and math scores ranged from 3.7 to 100.0, averaging 64.7 with a standard deviation of 15.8. 

## Analysis

The school with the lowest reading score was Dixon High School. Collectively, 11th and 12th graders had higher-than-average reading scores at 74.9. Overall, charter Schools had higher reading and math scores, as compared to public schools. When breaking these scores down by grade, one can see that 9th, 10th, and 11th graders at charter school students performed better than their counterparts in math. Interestingly, math scores for charter school students decreased as the grade increased. Public school 12th graders performed better than their counterparts in math. There is no downward trend for math scores among public school students. Montgomery High School had the largest student body while Chang High School had the smallest.
